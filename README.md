Domain Context
The project is set in the telecommunications domain, focusing on understanding customer behavior and predicting churn. Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies, where retaining existing customers is essential for maintaining a competitive edge.

## Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis: Insights into key factors contributing to customer churn.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and balancing the data using SMOTE.
Feature Engineering: Dimensionality reduction using PCA to improve model performance.
Modeling and Evaluation: Training multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost) and evaluating them using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models with GridSearchCV for enhanced performance.

Data Description
Source: The dataset is hypothetical and can be replaced with any telecom customer data.
Features: Customer demographics, service usage patterns, billing information, and more.
Target Variable: Churn - indicating whether a customer left the service or not.

Machine Learning Workflow
Data Collection: Loading and exploring the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling, and balancing the data.
Feature Engineering: Reducing dimensionality with PCA.
Model Building: Training various machine learning models.
Evaluation: Using metrics to assess model performance.
Deployment (Optional): Strategies for integrating the model into business operations.

## Results
The XGBoost model achieved an ROC-AUC score of [Insert Score] and an F1 score of [Insert Score], indicating a high level of predictive accuracy.
The model's insights helped in formulating retention strategies, effectively reducing churn rates.
